In this repository are examples of a react-native application built for iOS.

React Native is an open source mobile application framework created by Facebook in order to deliver a better mobile experience. It can be used to develop applications for Anndroid, iOS, Web, UWP.

## Background

I chose this technology in order to create a mobile version for my final project, an app for Martian weather. With a react-native version, more people would be able to access the application, rather than only through the browser.
